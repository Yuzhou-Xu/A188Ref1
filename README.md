A188 genome assembly and annotation

1. Sequencing data
- Nanopore data
Nanopore data were generated using ONT MinION with the FLO-MIN106 flowcells and the kit of SQK-LSK109. Basecalling was performed with Guppy (3.4.4).
- Illumina data
A188 PE125: BGI  
A188 PE250: Novogene

2. Canu1.9 assembly

3. Nanopolish and Pilon polishing

4. Hybrid scaffolding

5. Genetic mapping for further scaffolding

6. Contigs concatenation

7. Maker genome annotation

8. Othologs

9. Analyses related to the manuscript

X. SyRI structrual variation related to other maize genomes
