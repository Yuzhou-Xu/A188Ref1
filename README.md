A188 genome assembly and annotation

### Sequencing data
1. Nanopore data
Nanopore data were generated using ONT MinION with the FLO-MIN106 flowcells and the kit of SQK-LSK109. Basecalling was performed with Guppy (3.4.4).
2. Illumina data
A188 PE125: BGI  
A188 PE250: Novogene

### Canu1.9 assembly

### Nanopolish and polishing

### hybrid scaffolding

### Genetic mapping for further scaffolding

### maker genome annotation
