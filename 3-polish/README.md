### assembly polishing
After filtering contigs that were presumably derived from organelles or contamination, the remaining contigs were first polished with raw Nanopore reads that contained signal information using Nanopolish (0.11.0). Briefly, Nanopore reads were aligned with the contigs using the aligner Minimap2. Polymorphisms, including small insertions and deletions as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms, were called and corrected.
